Resource Management P5
________________________________________________

This project is  designed  and  implemented  a  resource  management  module  
for  our  Operating  SystemSimulatoross. In this project, you will 
use the deadlock detection and recovery strategy to manage resources.the beginning,oss will allocate shared memory 
for system data structures, including resource descriptors for each resource. All the resources are static but some of 
them may be shared.The resource descriptor is a fixed size structure and contains information on managing the resources 
withinoss. Make sure that you allocate space to keep track of activities that affectthe resources,  
such as request,  allocation,  and release. The resource descriptors will reside in shared memory and will be accessible to the children.
 When verboseis off, it should only log when a deadlock is detected, and how it was resolved. -v  will more information printed to the console and log file.
